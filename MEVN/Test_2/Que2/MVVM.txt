MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a software architectural pattern that is used to
 design user interfaces for desktop and mobile applications. 

It was first introduced by Microsoft in 2005 as a variation of 
the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

In MVVM, the application is divided into three major components:

1. Model: The model component represents the data and business logic of the application.
 It encapsulates the application data and provides the necessary methods for accessing 
 and manipulating the data.

2. View: The view component represents the user interface of the application. 
It is responsible for displaying the data to the user and capturing user input.

3. ViewModel: The viewModel component acts as a bridge between the view and the model. 
It provides the necessary data and functionality to the view and also communicates with 
the model to retrieve and update the data.

The key advantage of MVVM is its ability to separate the concerns of the application,
 allowing for easier development and maintenance. The view and viewModel components are 
 completely decoupled from the model, which means that changes to the user interface do 
 not affect the underlying data model.

Additionally, the use of data binding in MVVM simplifies the process of updating the
 view whenever the underlying data changes. This allows for a more responsive and dynamic
  user interface.

Overall, MVVM is a powerful architecture pattern that can help developers create scalable
 and maintainable applications with a clean separation of concerns between the UI and business
  logic.
